## Testing Principles
1. **Priority-Based Testing**
   - Focus on features that directly impact users
   - Defer non-critical feature testing
   - Maintain list of known, non-critical issues

2. **Efficient Test Selection**
   - Run critical path tests first
   - Automate repeatable tests
   - Use smoke tests for quick validation

3. **Risk Management**
   - Document known issues
   - Establish acceptable risk levels
   - Create contingency plans

## Deferrable Items
- Advanced feature testing
- Performance optimization
- Nice-to-have features
- Extended browser compatibility
- Comprehensive accessibility testing

## Success Criteria
- Core features work reliably
- Critical user paths are functional
- Basic security measures in place
- Acceptable performance under normal load
- Monitoring systems operational
