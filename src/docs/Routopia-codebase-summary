# Routopia Testing Status Report

## Current Testing Structure

### 1. Critical Path Tests
- **RouteComponents.test.tsx**
  - Core drawing functionality
  - Route preview rendering
  - Event handling
- **RouteOperations.test.tsx**
  - Route creation
  - Route saving
  - Basic map functionality

### 2. Integration Tests
- **RouteVisualization.test.tsx**
  - Feature interactions
  - Route rendering
  - Traffic overlay
  - Alternative routes
- **PredictiveRouting.test.tsx**
  - Route calculations
  - Preference handling
  - Data integration

## Testing Progress

### Strong Areas
1. Route Preview testing is comprehensive and reliable
2. Consistent service mocking patterns across tests
3. Good coverage of asynchronous operations
4. Clear test organization and structure

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Route Drawing Tests
- Current issues with event handling simulation
- Need better handling of canvas interactions
- Consider splitting complex drawing tests into smaller units

#### 2. Test Organization
- Could benefit from shared test utilities
- Some duplicate setup code across test files
- Need more consistent use of TestContextProvider

#### 3. Async Testing
- Inconsistent use of `act()` and `waitFor()`
- Some timing issues in animation/drawing tests
- Need clearer patterns for handling async operations

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Shared Test Utilities
