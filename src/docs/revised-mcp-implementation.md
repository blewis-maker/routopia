### Implementation Details

1. **Route Generation Process**
   ```typescript
   // 1. Generate main route (river)
   const mainRoute = await generateMainRoute(context);

   // 2. Find connection points
   const connectionPoints = await findConnectionPoints(mainRoute);

   // 3. Generate activity tributaries
   const tributaries = await generateTributaries(connectionPoints);

   // 4. Optimize combined route
   const optimizedRoute = await optimizeRoute(mainRoute, tributaries);
   ```

2. **Activity Types**
   - Transport: CAR (main routes)
   - Fitness: WALK, RUN, BIKE
   - Winter: SKI
   - Special: HIKE, PHOTO, FOOD, TEAM
