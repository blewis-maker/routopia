# Routopia Service Evolution Plan

## Current Mission Extension
```typescript
interface MissionExtension {
  currentScope: {
    routing: "Primary focus",
    intelligence: "AI-driven planning",
    context: "Real-time awareness"
  },
  
  evolutionPath: {
    phase1: "Enhanced POI Integration",
    phase2: "Smart Reservations Links",
    phase3: "Travel Convenience Features"
  }
}
```

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Smart Linking (Near Term)
```typescript
interface SmartLinking {
  restaurants: {
    features: [
      'Show availability windows',
      'Direct links to booking platforms',
      'Contact information display'
    ],
    integration: {
      partners: [
        'OpenTable API',
        'Resy API',
        'Google Reservations'
      ],
      display: 'Non-intrusive suggestions'
    }
  },
  
  accommodations: {
    features: [
      'Location-aware suggestions',
      'Price range indicators',
      'Direct booking links'
    ],
    integration: {
      partners: [
        'Google Hotels API',
        'Booking.com API',
        'External booking links'
      ],
      display: 'Route-relevant options'
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Route Intelligence Enhancement
```typescript
interface RouteIntelligence {
  mealPlanning: {
    timing: 'Suggest meal stops',
    location: 'Restaurant proximity',
    preferences: 'Cuisine matching'
  },
  
  stayPlanning: {
    timing: 'Suggest overnight stops',
    location: 'Hotel proximity',
    preferences: 'Accommodation type'
  }
}
```

## Future Vision Alignment

### Near Term (Current Mission)
- Keep focus on route planning
- Add smart suggestions
- Maintain separation of concerns

### Medium Term (Evolution)
- Integrate booking links
- Add reservation windows
- Include availability data

### Long Term (Expansion)
- Consider partnership APIs
- Evaluate booking integration
- Assess platform evolution

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Maintain Core Focus:
```typescript
interface CorePrinciples {
  routing: "Primary focus",
  suggestions: "Value add",
  bookings: "External handoff"
}
```

2. Integration Rules:
```typescript
interface IntegrationRules {
  suggestions: {
    timing: "Context appropriate",
    style: "Non-intrusive",
    value: "User beneficial"
  },
  handoff: {
    clean: "Clear platform transition",
    reliable: "Trusted partners",
    seamless: "Smooth user experience"
  }
}
```

## Feature Implementation Order

1. Phase 1: Enhanced Information
```typescript
interface EnhancedInfo {
  restaurants: {
    hours: boolean,
    cuisine: boolean,
    pricing: boolean,
    ratings: boolean
  },
  hotels: {
    availability: boolean,
    pricing: boolean,
    amenities: boolean,
    ratings: boolean
  }
}
```

2. Phase 2: Smart Integration
```typescript
interface SmartIntegration {
  features: {
    reservationWindows: boolean,
    availabilityChecks: boolean,
    priceComparisons: boolean,
    bookingLinks: boolean
  }
}
```

3. Phase 3: Advanced Features
```typescript
interface AdvancedFeatures {
  planning: {
    mealTimeSuggestions: boolean,
    overnightStops: boolean,
    multiDayPlanning: boolean,
    budgetOptimization: boolean
  }
}
```

This approach allows Routopia to:
1. Maintain its core routing focus
2. Add value through smart suggestions
3. Prepare for future expansion
4. Keep user experience cohesive

Would you like me to:
1. Detail specific API integrations?
2. Create UI components for these features?
3. Develop the suggestion logic?
4. Define more precise integration boundaries?

Remember: The goal is to enhance the route planning experience while maintaining Routopia's core identity as a route planning platform.

## Current Focus
```typescript
interface CurrentFocus {
  phase: 'core_implementation',
  priority: {
    routing: {
      status: 'starting',
      components: [
        'Route calculation engine',
        'Activity-specific pathfinding',
        'Real-time condition integration'
      ]
    },
    activities: {
      status: 'pending',
      next: 'Selection flow implementation'
    },
    realTime: {
      status: 'pending',
      next: 'Service integration setup'
    }
  }
}
```
