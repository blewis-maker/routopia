# RouteComponents Testing Progress - Updated Dec 2, 2024

## Current Status 🔄

### Completed Items ✅
1. Basic Test Infrastructure
   - [x] Set up TestContextProvider
   - [x] Implemented mock canvas context
   - [x] Added basic component rendering tests
   - [x] Created error boundary component
   - [x] Added detailed logging system

2. Event Handling
   - [x] Mouse event simulation setup
   - [x] Basic drawing sequence implementation
   - [x] Timer mocking configuration
   - [x] Animation frame handling

3. State Management
   - [x] Drawing state tracking
   - [x] Canvas context state management
   - [x] Progress callback implementation
   - [x] Component lifecycle handling

### Current Test Results 🔍
1. Passing Tests
   - [x] AuthenticationFlow.test.tsx (3 tests)
   - [x] DataIntegrity.test.tsx (2 tests)
   - [x] RouteAnimations.test.tsx (6 tests)
   - [x] RouteOperations.test.tsx (2 tests)

2. Failing Tests
   - [ ] RouteComponents.test.tsx
     - Issue: beginPath not being called during drawing operations
     - Duration: 7794ms (timeout at 5000ms)
     - Mock state remains unchanged after events

### Critical Issues 🚨
1. Mock Canvas Context
   - State not updating after mouse events
   - beginPath spy not being called
   - Drawing state remains idle
   - Context methods not properly connected

2. TypeScript Errors
   - [ ] Canvas context type mismatch
   - [ ] HTMLElement type assertions
   - [ ] Missing activityType prop

3. Event Handling
   - [ ] Mouse events not triggering drawing operations
   - [ ] State synchronization issues
   - [ ] Event propagation problems

### Next Steps 📝
1. High Priority
   - [ ] Fix mock canvas context implementation
   - [ ] Add proper type assertions for canvas element
   - [ ] Add required activityType prop to tests
   - [ ] Fix event handling synchronization

2. Medium Priority
   - [ ] Improve state tracking
   - [ ] Add missing canvas context methods
   - [ ] Enhance error handling
   - [ ] Add timeout handling

3. Low Priority
   - [ ] Add remaining test cases
   - [ ] Improve test coverage
   - [ ] Add performance testing
   - [ ] Document test patterns

## Testing Strategy 🎯
1. Fix Core Issues
   - Mock canvas context implementation
   - Event handling synchronization
   - Type definitions and assertions

2. Improve Test Structure
   - Better setup/teardown
   - More granular test cases
   - Better error handling

3. Enhance Coverage
   - Edge cases
   - Error scenarios
   - Performance aspects

## Notes 📝
- Mock canvas state remains unchanged despite events
- Test timeout occurring at 5000ms
- Multiple test runs show consistent failure pattern
- Event simulation working but not affecting state
