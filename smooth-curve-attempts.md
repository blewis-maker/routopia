## Test Requirements
- Input: Series of points defining a route
- Constraint: Angles between consecutive segments must be < 45°
- Output: Smoothed curve maintaining angle constraints
- Test Case: `handles smooth curve generation` in RouteComponents.test.tsx

## Implementation Attempts

### 1. Circular Arc Transitions ❌
