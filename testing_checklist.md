# Routopia Testing Checklist - Updated Dec 2, 2024

## Current Testing Summary (Dec 2, 2024)
We are currently focused on the RouteComponents.test.tsx integration tests, specifically the route drawing functionality. Key points:

1. Progress Overview:
   - 11/12 tests passing (91.7% success rate)
   - Main focus: Curve smoothing in route drawing
   - Current blocker: Angle constraints in smooth curves

2. Active Test:
   - Test: "handles smooth curve generation"
   - Issue: Angle difference (1.57 rad/90°) exceeding maximum (0.785 rad/45°)
   - Attempted solutions:
     - Direct angle interpolation
     - Bezier curves
     - Catmull-Rom splines
     - Point subdivision

3. Next Steps:
   - Resolve angle constraint issue in curve smoothing
   - Complete route cancellation testing
   - Implement activity type variations
   - Add performance testing

4. Overall Status:
   - Infrastructure tests: ✅ Complete
